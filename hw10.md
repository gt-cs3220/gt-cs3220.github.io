# HW10

**(Due: 04/08/22) Friday 6pm**

## Part 0 : Open jupyter notebook on pynq board cluster

[step 1] Allocate pynq board resources through [slurm workload manager](https://slurm.schedmd.com/quickstart.html). Make sure you're connected to Georgia Tech network or through the GT VPN.
```
[local]$ ssh [your GT account username]@synestia2.cc.gatech.edu
[synestia2]$ . /net/cs3220_share/student_scripts/init_student_vivado_env.sh
[synestia2]$ run-jupyter-pynq.sh
```
Running the scripts will allocate a 1-hour job on one of the available pynq boards. When prompted for password please enter the password for your GT account. 


[step 2] If the job launch was successful, you should see instructions like this:
```
Submitting job via sbatch lab1.sbatch...
Submitted batch job 82

Job successfully submitted!
Waiting for job to start...

Starting jupyter notebook...

Connect to your jupyter notebook via the following steps:
   1) Press SHIFT + ~ then SHIFT + C to open an SSH console (The prompt 'ssh>' should appear on the next line)
      ***Note: '~' MUST be the first character on the line to be recognized as the escape character, in which case it will not appear on your terminal.***
      ***If you see the '~' character when you start typing, delete it, hit 'ENTER' and type 'SHIFT' + '~' + 'C' again.***
   2) Type -L 51001:pynq-z2-1:51001 and then ENTER
   3) Connect your browser to http://localhost:51001/?token=8dc6a1794a5f3d36d7ac733caab6f7d91a9d9c1137f9cbd2
```
Follow the prompted instructions and start your jupyter notebook. The SSH console commands may not work for VS Code terminals. The notebook password is ```xilinx```.

Other useful instructions:
- ```sinfo``` checks the status of pynq board resources and show whether they are down, allocated or idle(available)
- ```squeue``` shows information about current submitted jobs
- ```scancel [job id]``` terminate a current job. Get your job id by ```squeue```
- ```slurm-jupyter-notebook -p pynq-cluster -N 1 --job-name lab2 --time=90:00``` allow you to specify a longer job time

## Part 1 : Follow the overlay tutorial with providied bistream  

In this part you'll run a tutorial program on jupyter notebook with tutorial bistream.

This instruction is based on [this tutorial](https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0/overlay_design_methodology/overlay_tutorial.html). 
The tutorial file is copied from this repo: https://github.com/PeterOgden/overlay_tutorial.git 


[step 1] Check out hw10_files from the class git

[step 2] Go to the directory with your GT account ID and upload files to pynq board's ARM processor  
(scalaradd.ipynb, tutorial_1.bit, tutorial_1.hwh) 
<img src="figs/hw10/jupyter0.png">

[step 3] Open scalaradd.ipynb in jupyternotebook and edit the file location to your directory (```/nethome/[GT account ID]```) in cell 1 and 7
 
Press the run button for each cell and see whether it works or not.

## Part 2 : Generate and run your own bistream
In this part, you will create a bitstream from Vivado and extend the tutorial to load your own bitstream design. 

### Step-Vitis: Open Vitis HLS and generate ip


**Start Vitis HLS program (similar to HW#9)**

[1] Click on “Create New Project” in the very first page.

[2] Specify the “Project name” and “location” of the project

[3] Click on “Add Files…” to add “<file_name>.cpp” and “<file_name>.h”. Do not add the test file yet.

[4] In the same window, click on Browse, to choose the top function (you can add it later).

[5] In the next window, click on “Add Files…” to add “test_<file_name>.cpp”, which is our testbench.

[6] In the next window, you can leave Solution Name and Period as it is, and just click on “…” to choose **pynq** boards. Then click “Finish”.

[7] Then, your project is opened. You can see the files in the left. 

[8] If you haven't added top module, open "project settings" and click "Synthesis" and add top module "add" in this example as top function. 

[9] To test the project, you can first “Run C Simulation” (you can find it under Project tab, or in the shortcuts). Once you click on that, a window appears, in which you may choose “Launch Debugger”, if you want to debug your code. Otherwise, you can just click on “OK” to run.

[10] "Solution"->"Run C Synthesis" ->"All Solutions"

[11] Set HLS version number: "Solution"->"Solution Settings":Export RTL : Ip Configuration: Version 0.0.1" 
<img src="figs/hw10/hls_version.png">

[12] "solution"->"Export RTL"   

[13] Copy AXI data register ids for inteface on the later step. The location for these IDs is in <project_name>/solution1/impl/ip/drivers/<module_name*>/src/<module_name>_hw.h

[14] Copy the data range somewhere to match with pynq boards. Please see below image as example of what data range we are talking about here. 

##define  _ADDR_*_DATA addresses 

<img src="figs/hw10/address.png"> 


### Step-Vivado:Open Vivado and import IP and generate Bitstream

**Start Vivado application**

[1] Create new project, select RTL project and then select pynq-z2 or pynq-z1 for your board. (you don't need to add any new files and just select default options)

[2] Click on the "IP Integrator/Create Block design," use default name "design_1", do "OK"

<img src="figs/hw10/setting.png">

[3] Project setting -> IP -> IP Repository -> Add the directory from the step-Vitis. 

```<project_name>/solution1/impl/ip```

<img src="figs/hw10/ipsetting.png">

<img src="figs/hw10/ipadd.png">

[4] On the block design windiw, add our HLS IP module (e.g., add in hw #10), add Zynq Processing system 

<img src="figs/hw10/add_diagram.png">



<img src="figs/hw10/add_ps.png"> 

[5] Click on the "Run block automation" and "Run connection automation"

<img src="figs/hw10/connection.png">

[6] Go to "sources" and right click on your block design name, click on "Create HLD wrapper". Click on "Let Vivado do" option and press "OK". 

<img src="figs/hw10/addhwwrapp.png">

<img src="figs/hw10/addhwwrapp-2.png">

[7] Click on Project -> Generate Bitstream (it will ask to synthesize etc. and click yes) 

<img src="figs/hw10/menu_bit.png">

[8] Click on File->Export-> Export block design, select the option of including bitstream 

<img src="figs/hw10/export_bit.png"> 


[8.a] Copy bit stream file ```*.bit```, for example <project_name>.runs/impl_1/design_1_wrapper.bit 


[8.b] Copy tcl script file ```*.tcl```, for example <project_name>.runs/impl_1/design_1_wrapper.tcl 

[9] Copy hwh file from <project_name>.gen/sources_1/bd/design_1/hw_handoff
you can find hwh file. 

[10] Make all files in the same names (e.g. add.bit, add.tcl, add.hwh) and place where they are easy to find  

[11] Upload the three files (add.hwh, add.tcl, add.bit) into pynq boards (as you did in Part 1)

[12] Repeat part-1 using jupyter-notebook with myadd.ipynb file   



### (Optional task) Part 3 Convert the add example to take 3 inputs and change the name of module to add3

**IMP Note: Please create new Vitis HLS project and new Vivado project for part 3**

In Part 2 you created an addition IP that used 2 ports (a & b). For Part 3, you need to modify add.cpp and adder.h to make it into 3 port IP. So inputs will be a,b,c and output will be d.

```d = a + b + c```

Name of module is add3.

Overview of general steps we follow:

Step [1] Open Vitis HLS and generate ip 

Step [2] Open Vivado: Add ip and PS and generate bitstream, metafiles  

Step [3] Copy the bitstream of add3 into jupyter (pynq boards)
