Assignment #1 



**CS 3220 Assignment #1: Pipeline design and introduction (video submission)** 

**Due:** 1/24/2021 (Sun) 6 pm

**Where to submit**: Canvas 

In this assignment, each student submits 5-min video for both part 1 & part 2. Before you record the video, you have to design a pipeline. So please read the instruction until the end. 

**Part 1**: Introduce yourself (3 min). 

Please explain yourself for 3 min.		

Example questions. 

Which year, when will you graduate, which thread/departments? 

What do you want to learn from this class? 

Are you in Atlanta or somewhere else? 

What makes you be excited? (not only CS subject, may be video games, sports, travel etc. )



**Part 2** : Explain your pipeline design in 2 min. In this project, you will design a 5-stage pipeline design (whatever tools that you prefer, it is also ok to draw it by hand.) You will explain your pipeline with a presentation view mode so that the whole screen shows your design. If you use a hand-drawing, first you take a photo and then upload the photo to your computer to use it. 
The purpose of this assignment is for you to review your pipeline design. Please watch a pipeline lecture if you want to review the material.
In your video, please explain two concepts. How a branch instruction is handled. (e.g.) how the front-end is stalled and how a new instruction is fetched after a target address is known. If a branch instruction is dependent on the previous instruction, how these are handled? 

​	In your pipeline design, we highly recommend you to use only the following units: ( MUX, n-bit comparator, AND, NAND, NOT, OR, NOR, XOR gates, Latches, registers, I-memory, D-memory. ). However, if you need more units, you can add them. You can assume that Instruction memory (I-memory) and Data memory (D-memory) are 1-cycle access latency. 

**Grading policy**: For this assignment, if you submit a 5-min video, you will get a full-credit.  The videos will be watched by the instructor and feedback will be provided especially about the pipeline design.
