Lab day #1 Assignments 

(Due : 1/27/21)



In this assignments, you will get familiar with Xilinix tool chain and verilog. 

Please checkout labday1 folder from the github. 

Before you start labday# 1 assignment, please watch verilog_intro.mp4 and labday1.mp4. videos. 

**What to submit**: a screenshot of final simulation. 

**Grading**: submit any Xilinix tool screenshot (0.5 points), a screenshot of the last task simulation (full credit 1 point)

**Note**: Lab day #1 is intentionally designed for short tasks. If you complete lab day #1 tasks, we strongly recommend to start Lab day #2 tasks. 

We won't grade the correctness of tasks in labday#1. However, we strongly encourage you to complete tasks and ask TAs/instructors during the lab day lecture hours if you face any problems. 

 

The folder has three subfolders( example_bus,example_v,simpleio) and simple three tasks. 

Task #1: start Vivado and try behavior examplebus simulation. We provide all the source code in a project so it should run w/o any modifications. 



Task #2: create a new vivado project with  files only in the example_v folder). You start a new project and follow the instructions to set vivado projet including simulation configurations.  Try behavior simulation. 



Task #3: change the code to have the following design in the module (use simple io folder) the simple in and out module based on the following definition. 

out1 =  in_1 & in_2 & in_3; 

out2 = in_1|in_2|in_3; 

You can use the same testing code to test your designs.
